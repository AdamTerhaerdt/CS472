**Explain if you saw improved response time with using Keep-Alive or not, and why you think you 
got about the same, worse or better response time between the two different program versions.**

When testing both the Connection: Close and Connection: Keep-Alive headers, I saw that the 
Connection: Keep-Alive header had a faster response time. This is because the Connection: Keep-Alive 
header allows the server to reuse the same connection for multiple requests, which reduces the 
time it takes to establish a new connection for each request. This is why I think that the 
Connection: Keep-Alive header had a faster response time.
